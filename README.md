# Calculator Application README

## Overview
This Calculator Application is a Java-based program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between user interface, business logic, and data handling.

## File Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Main.java**
   - The main entry point of the application. It is responsible for initializing and launching the calculator.

2. **CalculatorGUI.java**
   - Manages the graphical user interface (GUI) of the calculator. This component presents information to the user and captures user input.

3. **CalculatorModel.java**
   - Handles the data and core logic of the calculator, such as performing calculations and storing results.

4. **CalculatorControler.java**
   - Contains the logic for controlling calculator operations. This component acts as an intermediary between the Model and GUI.

In addition to these, there are corresponding interface files (`CalculatorControlerInterface.java`, `CalculatorModelInterface.java`, `CalculatorGUIInterface.java`) that define essential methods for each component. Also, an `application.css` file is included for styling the GUI.

## Usage
To run the application:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run `Main.java`.
